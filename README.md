# Website_Test

### I can't wait to see what I end up doing with this. 
<p>Testing how a basic website template should look like. I think I should take this more seriously & begin working using Git & Github </p>

<p>Basic test of the markdown syntax. </p>

# What happens when a heading level 1 is inserted again
## I guess this is the heading level 2 which lies below heading level 2. Ordinal - categorical features
### Do we run out of patience at level 3?
#### What do you call someone waiting to die in a hosptial? Patient. 
##### Waiting for someone to applause.
###### Nobody here.

<p>Paragraphs are just blocks of sentences put together. Sentences are just blocks of words put together. Words are just letters tied together.
  How is it then, when the grand purpose of sentences & their beauty of connecting & bringing things together is now driving us apart so</p>
<p>A writer is he who stays true to his thought. Even if it means he'll be condemned for it. To speak each word fearless even if you were held at gun point because you don't simply want to live. You want to live on</p>

<p>Should the first line proclaim it is the first line?<br>
  Or should the second line elevate it so? </p>
  
  **Writing weak sentences in a bold font**
  I guess bold font is just __weak font with a puffed up chest__
  Love<strong>is</strong>bold
  
  Italicized text is the *cat's meow*
  I'm just copying sentences off now _yeah_
  A *cute little kitten meows on the street, a cry about a lost lover no one knows*
  
  This text is ***really important & stylish too***
  This text here is like a ***Model on a ramp***
  
  >Creating block quotes
  Haha, I lied
  >I don't know how the output would look like.
  >I really hope life changes for the better
  >Yeah. I really do.
